# PersonalAlgorithmCustomizer
Tool for customizing online content recommendations
Personal Algorithm Customizer (PACT)

## Overview
This project aims to create an application that empowers users to take control of their digital profiles by customizing the content they are exposed to online. The tool allows users to manually input a list of search queries, which the app executes periodically in the background, influencing recommendation algorithms and advertising systems.

## Features
- Customizable query list for manual input.
- Automated search execution at random intervals.
- Profiles for different users or purposes (e.g., family-friendly, hobbies, educational).
- Privacy features, including optional VPN integration.

## Potential Use Cases
1. **Family-Friendly Content:** Redirect algorithms to focus on age-appropriate topics.
2. **Hobbies and Interests:** Shape recommendations around personal passions.
3. **Algorithm Manipulation:** Counteract unwanted ad targeting.
